It emphasizes the importance of recognizing workplace hazards and implementing a hierarchy of controls, with PPE as a last line of defense. The document describes various types of PPE, including eye and face protection, foot protection, head protection, hearing protection, environmental protection, respiratory protection, and high-visibility safety apparel, detailing their selection, use, maintenance, and compliance requirements. The standards aim to ensure the health and safety of workers on construction projects, within industrial areas, and when exposed to environmental hazards or engaged in maintenance activities.</p>
                <p class="mt-4">Metrolinx mandates that all PPE comply with current safety standards, such as those set by the CSA (Canadian Standards Association) and ANSI (American National Standards Institute). There is a strong focus on compatibility, ensuring that the use of multiple PPE types does not compromise their effectiveness. The document also outlines the roles and responsibilities of different organizational entities, including constructors, employers, and workers, emphasizing adherence to both Metrolinxâ€™s standards and the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act. It includes detailed procedures for the correct selection and fitting of PPE, with an emphasis on the proper maintenance and inspection of these protective items to maintain their effectiveness and the safety of the wearer.</p>
                <p class="mt-4">The document additionally covers the necessary compliance measures, revisions, and references to regulatory documents, ensuring that all Metrolinx personnel, as well as contractors and consultants, are equipped with the latest safety information and protocols. The overarching goal is to foster a culture of safety across all Metrolinx operations, highlighting the shared responsibility among all employees to prioritize and actively participate in maintaining a safe work environment.</p>
